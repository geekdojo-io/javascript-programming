Using Chrome Console is useful for writing a quick JavaScript code, but it can be frustrating when you have to write more than one line of JavaScript. You have to use 'Shift-Enter' for adding a new line, you have to use a up-arrow key to look for history of what you wrote. You get my point. Also, JavaScript is usually meant to run inside an HTML page. 

So, we are going to make our life easier by installing and using an app that helps writing HTML code and JavaScript code. Oh, and you didn't learn HTML? Don't worry. We're going to learn HTML today!
